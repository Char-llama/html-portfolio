<h1>The Best Movies According to Charlotte</h1>
<h2>My Top Movies from the 2000's</h2>
<p>...because we all know this was the best decade</p>

<h3>Legally Blonde</h3>
<p>Just iconic. Reese Witherspoon is like a Barbie and we love her for this role.</p>

<h3>The Parent Trap</h3>
<p>Would you believe this is Lindsay Lohan? Can watch this on repeat.</p>

<h3>The Princess Diaries</h3>
<p>Another iconic film. Love, love, love. Anne Hathaway is amazing.</p>

<h3>The Devil Wears Prada</h3>
<p>Would love this just for the fashion. But what a cast to boot too.</p>

<h3>She's The Man</h3>
<p>Bit of a guilty pleasure... Channing Tatum and Amanda Bynes are a hilarious duo.</p>

<h3>Step Up</h3>
<p>This sets my dance soul on fire. I have played the final dance (and song) on repeat.</p>

<h3>What A Girl Wants</h3>
<p>Seeing a trend yet? Amanda Bynes at her best. Funny and tugs on the heart strings with the father/daughter relationship.</p>

<h3>Miss Congeniality</h3>
<p>FBI + pageants + Sandra Bullock.</p>
